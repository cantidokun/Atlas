# Atlas Current Development Handoff

**Updated:** September 3, 2026 — Stage 15 complete for current contract; Stage 16 proposal-only Qwen boundary implemented
**Blender continuation branch:** `feat/blender-stage11-mainline`
**Blender PR:** #49 — open, draft, unmerged
**Stage status:** Stage 15 COMPLETE FOR CURRENT CONTRACT; Stage 16 IN PROGRESS

## Current authority model

```text
Qwen / AI
  -> reason and propose structured production intent

Python / Atlas
  -> validate, resolve, authorize, execute, track state, verify, recover

Blender / Unreal
  -> controlled production execution

Independent verification
  -> establish what actually happened
```

Qwen never receives direct production execution authority. Atlas remains the authority layer.

## Stage 15 — COMPLETE FOR CURRENT CONTRACT

Stage 15 introduced a semantic production-goal layer without introducing a second execution engine. `ProductionTaskDefinition` represents meaningful soccer-production objectives with objective, domain, deliverables, constraints, evidence, ordered actions, target evaluation, and an action-tool allowlist. It compiles directly into the existing `AtlasTaskDefinition`, preserving the single canonical autonomous runtime.

Reusable `ProductionTaskFragment` composition supports named fragment ordering, semantic fragment dependencies, fragment-level evidence/actions, deliverables, constraints, and descriptive metadata. Executable ordering remains governed by `ActionSpec.depends_on` and the existing deterministic future controller.

Canonical soccer-production templates currently include `GoalPositionTemplate`, `GoalOrientationTemplate`, and `BroadcastGoalPreparationTemplate`.

`planning/soccer_production_catalog.py` provides the canonical versioned workflow catalog. Current contract:

```text
broadcast-goal-preparation@1

file_name       -> string
object_name     -> string
target_location -> vector3
target_rotation -> vector3
```

The catalog validates exact identity/version, required and unexpected parameters, declared parameter kinds, vector shape, and finite numeric values before template construction. Compilation records the exact catalog descriptor and normalized parameters as semantic provenance.

`AutonomousTaskRuntime` persists task metadata at start and authorized replan, and resume/reconstruction requires semantic metadata to match the task definition. Tampered semantic provenance fails closed.

The real Blender 4.4 environment live-verified the catalog -> semantic task -> existing autonomous runtime path and a two-process failure/recovery path. The recovery proof verified version identity, typed parameter contract, semantic provenance recovery, no replay of the completed prerequisite, fresh recovery evidence, explicit replan authorization, replacement execution, independent final verification, and fixture restoration.

Stage 15 therefore closes for the current contract.

## CI checkpoint

GitHub Actions `Atlas Tests` run **#1370** passed for the Stage 15 recovery-harness stabilization commit `a8d81196b3bccc1c674d6038ff6fee115b24d8ec`. Earlier Stage 15 commits also passed runs #1365, #1366, #1367, and #1368. Run #1362 failed because stale catalog tests did not yet include the typed parameter contract; those regressions were corrected.

The Stage 15 live recovery itself was user-verified against Blender 4.4.

## Stage 16 — Qwen proposal integration IN PROGRESS

Stage 16 now begins at the proposal-resolution boundary rather than the execution layer.

Implemented:

- `qwen/production_proposal.py` defines `QwenProductionProposal` as an intent-only envelope containing `workflow`, optional `version`, and `parameters`;
- `validate_qwen_production_proposal(...)` rejects malformed proposal shapes and unknown top-level fields before catalog resolution;
- `compile_qwen_production_proposal(...)` resolves the proposal exclusively through the trusted Stage 15 soccer-production catalog and returns one canonical `ProductionTaskDefinition`;
- catalog validation remains responsible for workflow identity, version, required parameters, parameter kinds, vector shape, and finite numeric values;
- Qwen proposal input cannot specify an executor, authorization ID, scheduling instruction, recovery operation, or arbitrary tool invocation;
- regression coverage proves malformed Qwen envelopes, unknown workflows, bad parameter kinds, and attempted execution fields are rejected;
- successful Qwen compilation retains workflow/version and normalized parameter provenance in the resulting task metadata.

The intended Stage 16 flow is:

```text
Qwen
  ↓
reason about soccer-production objective
  ↓
propose workflow + version + parameters
  ↓
Atlas validates proposal envelope
  ↓
Atlas resolves trusted catalog contract
  ↓
Atlas constructs one ProductionTaskDefinition
  ↓
existing Atlas authorization/runtime/verification/recovery
```

This is a proposal adapter, not an autonomous Qwen executor. Qwen still cannot authorize, execute, persist, recover, or choose arbitrary tools.

### Next Stage 16 work

The next step is to connect an actual Qwen/structured-output provider boundary to `QwenProductionProposal` while keeping provider output untrusted and inert until Atlas validation succeeds. The provider adapter must normalize model output into the narrow proposal envelope and must not expose runtime/executor APIs.

After that boundary is proven, we can add a controlled end-to-end test showing model proposal -> Atlas validation -> catalog resolution -> canonical task construction, with execution still separately gated by Atlas.

Do not expand Qwen autonomy beyond proposal generation and proposal parsing at this point.

## Unreal

The local Unreal Engine 5.6 production boundary remains proven for the implemented capabilities: deterministic render configuration, render-state verification, Movie Render Queue submission, dynamic job-ID binding, asynchronous inspection, semantic completion verification, MRQ artifact discovery, filesystem validation, and evidence-bound persistent render receipts.

Cross-process Unreal render-job recovery is not implemented.

## Resolution / 4K direction

Atlas is intended to operate on source soccer footage including 4K/UHD. The existing 640x360 Unreal render is a controlled boundary test, not a source-footage maximum. Resolution affects decode, tracking, memory, storage, reconstruction, compositing, and render throughput, but does not change the core Atlas orchestration model.

Use resolution-aware workload/resource handling rather than a separate 4K architecture. Preserve the original high-resolution source as authoritative and use proxies/intermediates where appropriate without weakening provenance or evidence.

## Non-regression rules

- Never give Qwen direct production execution authority.
- Never automatically retry failed writes.
- Never silently mutate an authorized plan.
- Never declare completion from a transport/write response alone.
- Keep engine-specific behavior behind adapter/tool boundaries.
- Preserve independent verification and the evidence ledger.
- Do not introduce parallel execution until dependency semantics are independently proven safe.
- Preserve the canonical Digital Twin as distinct from Unreal, Blender, photogrammetry outputs, and temporary production artifacts.

## PR status

PR #49 remains open, draft, and unmerged. **Do not merge unless explicitly requested.**

## Resume point

**Continue Stage 16 by integrating a provider-facing structured Qwen output boundary into the proposal-only adapter. Keep provider/model output untrusted and inert until Atlas validates it against the Stage 15 catalog; no Qwen execution or authorization autonomy yet.**
